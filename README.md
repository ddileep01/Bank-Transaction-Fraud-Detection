# 🏦 Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

## 📚 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect fraudulent bank transactions using machine learning. By analyzing transaction patterns, the objective is to build a predictive model that can identify suspicious activities and reduce financial risks.

## 🔧 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans data, handles missing values, removes duplicates, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes fraud distribution and provides statistical insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepares and scales features for optimal model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## 📚 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bank Transaction Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/marusagar/bank-transaction-fraud-detection)
- **Attributes**: Transaction details, customer information, amount, transaction type, and fraud labels.

## 💪 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## 📖 Installation & Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ddileep01/Bank-Transaction-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python Bank-Transaction-Fraud-Detection.py
   ```

## 📊 Results  
- **Random Forest** generally outperforms **Logistic Regression** due to its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and complex relationships.
- The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into model accuracy and fraud detection capabilities.

## 📝 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively detect fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions mitigate risks and enhance security.
